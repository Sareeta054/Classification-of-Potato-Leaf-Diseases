# Classification of Potato Leaf Diseases Using KNN

This project focuses on identifying and classifying potato leaf diseases using a machine learning approach. It utilizes the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm implemented from scratch, with a graphical user interface (GUI) developed using **PyQt5** for ease of use. The system allows users to browse images of potato leaves and view disease classification results in real time.

## 📌 Features
- 🧪 KNN algorithm implemented from scratch  
- 🖼️ Image classification interface built with PyQt5  
- 🔄 Data augmentation techniques to handle small dataset sizes  
- 📊 Visualization and analysis using OpenCV, NumPy, and Pandas  
- 💻 Lightweight desktop application  

## 🧠 Algorithms Used
**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Implemented manually without using machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python  
- PyQt5 – for GUI development  
- OpenCV – for image processing  
- NumPy – for numerical operations  
- Pandas – for data handling and analysis  

## 🗃 Dataset
- Potato leaf images categorized by disease type.  
- Due to a limited number of images, **data augmentation** techniques were applied (such as rotation, flipping, scaling) to artificially expand the dataset and improve model performance.

## 📷 Application Interface
The desktop app allows users to:
- Browse images from local storage  
- Automatically classify the image  
- View the result in a simple, intuitive GUI
